# US-president Speeches Research
The study data crawled through the Scrapy framework from [The American Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/). The crawler code and the result as a JSON file can be found in the folder “scrapy-speechs”. The dataset includes the speech contents relative to “China” and the corresponding metadata, i.e., speech title, president name, and date. There are 10 Presidents, from President Nixon to President Biden, in the dataset. In the “Speech_Analyzer” folder, you can find how the study used the models for subjective-neutral style analysis, sentiment analysis, and causal impact analysis. The analysis results were plotted using an interactive graphing library, Plotly. You can find these pictures of the result in the “output pictures” folder.
